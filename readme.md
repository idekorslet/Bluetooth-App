# Welcome

App ini adalah versi upgrade dari projek [Flutter Bluetooth sebelumnya](https://github.com/idekorslet/Belajar-Flutter/tree/main/Flutter_Bluetooth_ESP32),
yang mana source code asalnya diambil dari [sini](https://blog.codemagic.io/creating-iot-based-flutter-app/)

This App is an upgraded version of the previous [Flutter Bluetooth project](https://github.com/idekorslet/Belajar-Flutter/tree/main/Flutter_Bluetooth_ESP32),
which the original source code is taken from [here](https://blog.codemagic.io/creating-iot-based-flutter-app/)
##
App yang ada disini adalah versi standard, berbeda dengan versi yang saya upload di Playstore, jadi kalian bisa mengubah tampilan sesuai dengan yang kalian kehendaki.
Kalian bisa cek versi saya yang ada di Playstore di link berikut: [Bluetooth Dev Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noobpro.bluetooth_dev_control)

The app here is the standard version, different from the version I uploaded on the Playstore, so you can change the appearance according to what you want.
You can check my version in the Playstore at the following link: [Bluetooth Dev Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noobpro.bluetooth_dev_control)
